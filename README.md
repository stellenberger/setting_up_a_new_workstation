# Setting up a new workstation

I created this as a reference for myself to look back to when I set up a new machine. This is specifically set up to accomodate the *ruby* and *java* developer. However, if you are a web developer in general, you will probably still find this set-up somewhat useful. I would just skip the RVM, Ruby and pry steps and you are good to go.
